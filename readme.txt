Inline Tag Thing allows you to add and remove tags on posts, inline, using magical AJAX powers.

== Description ==

Inline Tag Thing allows you to easily remove tags from posts,  and add new tags to a post.  It provides a text box and button which allows adding one or more tags (For multiple tags, enter a comma separated list),  and existing tags have a - link which will remove a tag from a post.

To perform these manipulations, you need to have the permissions to edit the underlying post.  If you don't have edit permissions,  the box will not display.
